description: The banner, the one send whose arrival is the point, and the copy that turns people away.

Admin → Messages holds everything the install says in your voice.

## The banner

A line across the top of every page, in an administrator's voice. Set it, clear
it; both are audited and both show up under the `settings` filter on Activity.

Good for: a maintenance window, a deprecation date, a "we know, we are on it".

Bad for: anything that has to be *read*. A banner is seen by whoever happens to
open Launchpad.

## The announcement email

**The announcement is the one send whose arrival is the point.** Everything else
in [notifications](../email/) is something you can afford to lose. This is not.

So it has stricter rules, and they are worth knowing before you send one.

**Write, test, send.** You compose it, send yourself a test, and then send it. The
composer shows an **estimate of the audience before you send**, including who
would be skipped and why.

**The freeze is one guarded transition, and both refusals come before it.**
Concurrent sends yield one acceptance and the rest are refused. No relay
configured is refused as `relay_not_configured`; an empty audience is refused as
`empty_audience` — and in both cases the announcement is **still a draft**, not a
half-sent record.

**Every resolved person gets a row with an outcome**, and the counts are those
rows: delivered, failed, skipped, abandoned. **One message per recipient**, never
one message with N addresses in it.

**A count that cannot distinguish outcomes is not a record.** Sent, failed and
skipped are different numbers, not a percentage.

**A failure is a count, not a fourth status.** An announcement that partly failed
is not in a new state; it has failures.

**A restart abandons and never resumes.** A half-sent announcement is not silently
continued after a restart — that would double-send. The abandoned rows say so.

**Two skip reasons, named back to you.** A locked account is `skipped/locked`; one
with no address is `skipped/no_address`. Both appear in the estimate before you
send, which is usually the moment you discover that a third of your directory has
no address here.

**One audience no switch silences.** There is a set of people who will be told, and
no notification preference removes them from it.

## A sent announcement is a record

**No edit, no delete, no un-send.** Those are `409` on a sent row.

It has its own retention — `announcement_recipient_retention_days` — which prunes
the per-recipient rows and **never the counts**.

## The copy that turns people away

Four messages, and they are the difference between a person doing the right thing
and a person filing a ticket:

| Message | Shown when |
|---|---|
| **No account** | They authenticated and no provider will create an account. |
| **Locked account** | Their account is locked. |
| **Awaiting activation** | Their account exists and nobody has activated it. |
| **Account activated** | Emailed when you activate them. |

Each should name **who to contact**. "Access denied" is a message that generates
work for you; "Ask #it-help to request a Launchpad account" is one that does not.

There is a fifth, for apps: **the locked app message**, the install's default copy
for what a visitor sees at a [locked](../../apps/locking/) app's URL.

## The knowledge base

One app on this install that everybody is pointed at — your runbook, your
handbook.

- **The label and description are yours**, not derived from the app. Renaming the
  app does not rename a word in everybody's chrome.
- **Setting it grants nothing.** The link is absent for anybody who could not
  already read that app. The pick is not a share.
- **Anonymous visitors never see it**, even if the picked app is public.
- **Nothing reads the app's framework.** Any app can be it.

Three negatives are one answer: nothing picked, the app was deleted, and the app
is not for you all return the same bytes. Whoever cannot see it cannot tell which.

It appears as a link at the end of the header, and on the Documentation page.
